# Decision about when to build depot and make it live is tough
# This depot build process could take a bit of time.
# At this moment, Even servers are down, but ready to go
# and Odd servers are still running the old version and accepting new players
#
# There's no way to do this without the possibility of someone slipping through
# the cracks and connecting to a mis-matched-version server.
#
# Client should catch this and display an error message when it happens.
#
# So, all we can do is minimize the amount of time during which this can happen.
#
# Since the depot build can take a while, we do it here, while Odd servers are
# still running, so everyone can keep playing during the build.
#
# The shutdown operation of Odd servers should be quick, and the startup
# operation of Even servers should be quick as well.
#
# During that moment, some Steam users, who already have the new version,
# will see a SERVERS UPDATING message, because they will connect to outdated
# Odd servers that are still running.
#
# The worst thing that can ever happen to Non-Steam users is that they find
# all servers shutdown (in the moment between Odd shutdown and Even startup).
