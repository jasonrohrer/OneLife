server.php
?action=get_sequence_number
&email=[email address]

Return:

&email=[email address]
&sequence_number=[int]
&hash_value=[hash value]

Return:
OK
-or-
DENIED

Used by game servers to indicate that a given email has been granted access to
Another Planet.

DENIED is returned if there are no life tokens left.


hash_value is computed on both ends with:

HMAC_SHA1( $shared_secret, $sequence_number$email )

(sequence number concatonated with email)



Where $shared_secret is a secret string known to both the ahapGate server and
the game servers that have permission to manipulate the ahapGate.

If sequence number is <= previously used sequence number for this email address,
request will be rejected.

Secure against replay attacks and modification of submitted email.
