Do whatever you want with it, absolutely no restrictions, and no permission 
necessary, as far as copyright issues are concerned.


In areas outside the reach of copyright, I still retain other rights.  This
should go without saying, because this file is called "no_copyright".


Specifically:

1.  I retain my moral rights.  I am the original author of One Hour One Life,
    and you are not, so don't claim or imply that you are.  The version of
    One Hour One Life that I have created and released is the only version
    specifically authorized by me, the original author, and I wanted it to be
    just the way that it is.  Do not claim or imply that your versions or 
    alterations are authorized by me, or take actions that would confuse
    people about which version is the original.

2.  I retain my publicity rights, and my rights against defamation.
    Do not claim or imply that I endorse, approve, or am financially
    connected to whatever you're doing with my work.  Do no lie about
    me or my work, or mislead people about my work.

3.  I retain my trademark rights.  The name "One Hour One Life", my logos,
    banners, trailers, and screen shots, along with the specific graphical,
    auditory, and character elements in the official game, are my trademarks
    for the multiplayer online game service that I'm operating.  Do not operate
    your own separate multiplayer online game service using any of these
    marks, unless your service is explicitly limited to confirmed and verified
    customers of my service.
