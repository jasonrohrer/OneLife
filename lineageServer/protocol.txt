Used by game servers to log end of a life.

hash_value is computed on both ends with:

HMAC_SHA1( $shared_secret, $sequence_number )


Where $shared_secret is a secret string known to both the reviewServer and
the game servers that have permission to post game stats.

If sequence number is <= previously used sequence number for this email address,
request will be rejected.


display_id  is the object ID of the player character.
parent_id   is -1 for Eve
killer_id   is -1 if player not murdered

name and last_words must be URL-encoded (Maybe+Like+This)
