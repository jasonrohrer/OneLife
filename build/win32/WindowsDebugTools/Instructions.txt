Copy all of these files into your main OneLife folder.



If the game runs in fullscreen mode, it will cover up the debugger if
a crash is caught.

So, put it in windowed mode first:

Run OneLife the normal way and switch it out of fullscreen mode on the
SETTINGS page.  Restart it, then quit.




Now that the game is launching in windowed mode, you can debug it by
double-clicking   debug.bat

If a crash happens, a stack trace will be printed in the window and
also output to   debugOut.txt

Email debugOut.txt to me at:  jasonrohrer@fastmail.fm


Also, before quitting the debugger, check if I'm online in Discord here:

I may walk you through some interactive debugging after I look at the
stack trace.



Once you're done debugging, enter  q  at the (gdb) prompt to quit.
