Scheduling a server code update (local and remote) for tonight at 9:30 UTC.
++++

Run a server code update (local and remote) NOW.
++++

1. Commit and push code in OneLife and minorGems

2. Log in as jcr15@onehouronelife.com

3. Run ~/checkout/OneLifeWorking/scripts/updateServerCode.sh





++++
Generating platform-specific (binary code) update for a platform.
++++

1. Update game.cpp version number.

NOTE:  On Mac and Linux, steps 2-4 can be accomplished with these scripts:
       pullBuildAndPostMac.sh
       buildAndPostLinux.sh
       
       On Windows, a manual pull is needed in both minorGems and OneLife,
       and then steps 2-4 can be accomplished with:
       buildAndPostWindows.sh

2. Build on each platform

3. Run minorGems/game/diffBundle/diffBundle to generate an incremental binary
   bundle for each platform.

4. scp the .dbz files to jcr15@onehouronelife.com:diffBundles/

(Do Steps 1-4 for all plaforms before doing step 5.)

No longer needed with latest git pull Unix Source distribution:
|
| 5. Build UnixSource bundle and scp it to 
|    jcr15@onehouronelife.com:oneLifeDownloads/

No longer needed because postPlatformDiffBundle.sh tags automatically
|
| 6. Run "git tag -a" in Onelife and minorGems to tag version and push with
|    "git push --tags" (to push the tags to the remote server).
|    (Do this here so that UnixSource folks get latest tagged versions.)


7. Log in as jcr15@onehouronelife.com

8. Run ~/checkout/OneLifeWorking/scripts/postPlatformDiffBundle.sh

No longer needed with latest git pull Unix Source distribution:
|
| 8. Editting www/ticketServer/settings.php to list latest UnixSource build.
|

9. git pull in minorGems and OneLife on working laptop.





++++
Adding new Linode remote server (game server, download server).
++++

1. Create a Linode in control panel, install Ubuntu LTS on it, boot it.

2. Note the IP address and root password, and give it a name 
   (server3, download2).

3. Add DNS A record here:
   https://manager.linode.com/dns/domain/onehouronelife%2Ecom

4. Log in to root@onehouronelife.com

5. Wait 15+ minutes for DNS to propagate.
   Check with:
   nslookup  newdomain.onehouronelife.com   ns1.linode.com
   NOTE:  don't ping it too early or a negative record will be cached.

6. run ~/checkout/OneLife/scripts/rootAddNewDownloadServer.sh
       OR
       ~/checkout/OneLife/scripts/rootAddNewRemoteServer.sh



++++
