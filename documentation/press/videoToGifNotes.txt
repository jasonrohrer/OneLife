New gif size:  480x240
Fits on Steam store page without getting cut off

Lightworks only supports 16:9, though.

So, need to build video at 1280x720.

Pre-crop titles centered on 1280x640, and then pad bottom of image up to 720.




To make an optimized 480x270 10 FPS gif from a 1280x720 30 FPS video,
don't forget the color fuzz factor.
 

ffmpeg -i Edit2\(1\).mp4 -vf scale=480:-1:flags=lanczos,fps=10 frames/ffout%03d.png

convert -loop 0 -delay 10 -layers Optimize -fuzz "5%" frames/ffout*.png output.gif
