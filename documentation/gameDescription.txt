From the teaser video release email, December 27, 2017:


A near-infinite, persistent online world full of untouched wilderness.  Build a new civilization from scratch, starting from rocks and sticks.  When you join the game, you're born as a helpless baby, with another player as your mother.  Each minute marks a passing year, and over the course of an hour, you will live a full life, having children of your own along the way in the form of other players, then growing old yourself, and eventually dying.  Hopefully, in your brief lifetime, you can make your own small contribution to this growing world, passing something useful down to your children and grandchildren.

Rebuild the world, from arrowheads to iPhones, across hundreds of generations.



250-character mini description (September 4, 2018):

Join the server as a helpless baby, with another player as your mother. A year passes each minute as you grow up. Leave your mark on the world before you die, and have kids of your own, as you help to rebuild civilization across many generations.
