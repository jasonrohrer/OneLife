Version 78    2018-April-20

--Fixed spread of appearing use sprites by rounding instead of flooring.  If
  there was only one sprite, it would appear at 7/8 uses.  Now it appears at
  4/8 uses.

--Allow creation sound to play for held item when it changes even if the
  on-ground target object changes too (example:  tool breaking when chopping
  wood).

--Fixed so that usingSound will play correctly when an on-the-ground object
  changes (example:  dumping water into goose pond).  This was broken in v66
  with the fix to sound for swapping contained items (thanks Uncle Gus).

--Fixed remap random source to seed with playerID.

--Auto-generation of variable objects triggered by $N in description, which
  generates N versions of that object and its transitions automatically.
  Example:  Key $10 generates 10 types of keys and Locked Door $10 generates
  matching doors.
 



Server Fixes:

--Fixed to handle dropping of contained objects when held container shrinks.

--Force drop when non-permanent held object decays into a permanent.

--Fixed bug in decaying, shrinking sub container.

--If numUses of actor and newTarget matches, and newActor doesn't have uses,
  then the used status of the actor is preserved in the newTarget.

--If numUses of target and newActor matches, and actor doesn't have uses, then
  the used status of the target is preserved in the newActor and decremented
  (counts as a use of the actor).

--Substitution of last-use of actor when used target produces an over-used
  newActor.

--Uses left can be decremente if actor and new actor have the same number of
  uses (example:  dumping shovel of dung uses shovel once).  Fixed some
  rounding errors in use transfer.

--Can no longer feed other people remap-trigger foods.

--Easier to kill a moving player.  Spots before and after them on their
  current path are considered as valid targets.

--New baby distribution algorithm.  Possible mothers are weighted by how close
  they are to ideal temperature instead of how full their food bars are.


  



Version 77    2018-April-17

--Added skipFPSMeasure.ini setting that can be used to disable FPS check on
  login screen.

--Fixed so that monumentCall sound is always loaded, even if monument is far
  away, so that it can play when monumentCall is triggered.  People weren't
  actually hearing it from far away.  Oops.

--Fixed speed calculation for various paper slide-in animations when target
  frame rate not 60.

--On version mismatch, a button to disable custom server is shown.

--Client now counts any later server version as a mismatch, but allows earlier
  server versions if that version matches our client data version (to allow
  client binary updates to fix bugs without restarting the servers).

--Fixed several bugs in TextArea code that could lead to crashes on Review page.

--Fixed zombie player that could be discovered radius of 32 if a player walked
  out of range and then you walked over to their last-known spot later. 




Server Fixes:

--Wound object no longer dropped if player wounded more than once.

--Fixed so that deathETA not reset if player wounded a second time, also
  blocked their death being logged twice.

--Turned off badMotherLimit.  With birth cooldown, it really isn't needed, and
  a mother can be punished by suicidal babies and become infertile.

--Fixed occurence of ~ for home directory inside quotes in various BASH scripts.

--Instead of using last Eve location before shutdown as new Eve location on
  next server startup, server remembers death location of longest lineage
  person who died during the shutdown process and uses that as the new Eve
  location on next startup.  That location is still used for the next three
  Eves post-startup, to give people three chances to get the pre-shutdown
  civilization up and running.  As a fall-back, if no shutdown death location
  has been saved, server looks for tallest, most-recenly-built monument
  location and uses that for the new Eve location.

--Added timestamp per monument step in monument logs.

--Changed monument tracking to only log monuments when second layer is built,
  and cleared old monument logs containing only one line.

--Main server backup script backs up monument logs.

--Monument reports for website.

--Fixed redundant if statement in transition bank (thanks UncleGus).

--Eves are now spread in a circle around the server-startup-Eve-origin point
  with a radius of 1000.  They won't keep random-walking further and further
  away.

--Mr. Still-Pretty-Nice-Guy.  Eating bonus 2, down from 3.

--Animals now stay in their spawning biome if moving radomly or fleeing.  Can
  still leave their biome in chase or fixed cardinal direction moves.
  Rattlesnakes stay in the desert, pengins stay in the snow.  Except for the
  rare borderlands rattlesnake or penguin who spawns off the edge.  They will
  also stay in their biome forever (a swamp penguin will always stay in the
  swamp if it spawns there).  But in general, you can travel in non-desert
  areas without much snake danger. 





Version 74    2018-April-13

--Fixed editor to allow smaller map chances.

--Fixed editor to NOT apply < 1.0 speed multiplier on ground animations, to
  match client behavior.  Thanks TyrantNomad.

--Fixed update process to NOT rewrite a lingering .bak file that failed to be
  deleted.  On Windows, we must move our EXE out of the way, but on a
  multi-part update, this results in trying to move it to the .bak file
  multiple times, with later moves failing.

--Fixed postUpdate process to remove any lingering .bak files.

--Client displays red speech for staggering murder victims before death, and
  shows bloody GUI overlay to victim.

--Fixed three bugs in copying map animation data when a new chunk arrives
  (thanks Christoffer Baar).

--Added support for sprite remapping.

--Support for monument call.




Server Fixes:

--Bug reporting back on in server.

--Apocalypse off again for now.

--Fixed various scripts to handle git tag changes.

--Fixed so that server checks apocalypsePermitted setting live, when about to
  trigger an apocalypse.

--After a family line dies out, next Eve is spawned in a random direction 2000
  tiles away.  After a server restart, the next three Eves are spawned around
  the last Eve location before restart, and then the random-2000 jumping starts
  for the fourth and subsequent Eves.

--Held baby was killed if dangerous animal walked over its last ground
  position.  Fixed.

--Fixed website stats generation.

--Bug reporting back off.  I think it may be causing a CPU vicious cycle.

--Disabled biome database to memorize proc-genned biome map.  This helped
  preserve seen map areas when a new biome was added, but it consumed gobs of
  RAM and CPU resources as players and Eve spreading explores huge areas of
  wilderness.  New biomes aren't added that often, and it's okay for them to
  shift under existing villages for now.  No longer saving look time for every
  single map cell that is seen, only for modified cells. 

--Switched to a stack implementation of a hash table database to improve
  performance on the most recent items.  Thus, performance won't degrade as
  much as more and more areas of the map are explored.

--Further improved performance of stack-based database implementation,
  especially on case of repeated misses.  Individual operations are between 3x
  and 10x faster than old kissDB engine, with 7x average speed improvement over
  a whole range of operations on test data.  StackDB also uses 6% less disk
  space for this test data, and 13,000x less RAM (plus, RAM usage is constant
  regardless of data size, where kissDB RAM usage grows over time as data
  grows).  The only place where stackDB is slightly slower is iterating through
  all database items, but this only happens when rebuilding a database to cull
  at startup, and we make up for it with the dramtically faster insertion
  performance of the stack.

--Server now makes use of high-performance STACKDB_put_new when rebuilding
  databases during the map cull after restart.  Shrank table in eve location
  database to save disk space given long email key.

--Added 20 seconds of 'stagger around' time after you are murdered.  Server
  sends clients a DY message to indicate that a player has entered this state.

--Optimization:  Valgrind profiler found 40% of CPU on a live 20-player server
  spent on computeMapBiomeIndex.  Caching this in a RAM-based hash table.

--Fixed so that if we're holding something permanent that can only be dropped
  with a use-on-bare-ground action, we drop the result of that use-on-bare-
  ground action when we die (instead of leaving permanent version of the held
  object on the ground after death).

--Support for monument logging and monument call to client.





Version 72    2018-April-5

--Server now reports its version number in its first SN number, and client
  displays error on version mismatch.

--Fixed incorrect CONNECTION LOST message in client when death reason known
  but user is clicking after death, when server socket has already been closed.
  Now clicks immediately after death are prevented client-side.

--Fixed editor bug where sound paste button not visible after recording.

--Fixed bug in clothing click detection if clothing contains rotated sprites
  that are further roted by the worn (held) animation along with custom
  rotation offsets (example:  seal skin coat).

--A lot of client BUG reports seem to be due to simple networking lag.  Maybe
  some clients really are seeing server responses that take more than 4
  seconds.  Updating BUG threshold to 10 seconds.

--Mac fullscreen mode fixed (using borderless window AND hiding menu/dock).
  Thanks Chard.

--Support in client and server for The Apocalypse, and propagation of
  apocalypse wave through all official servers via the reflector.

--Client now sends server KA keep-alive message every 15 seconds of player
  idleness to make sure a NAT or other router doesn't drop the connection if
  idle.

--Fixed so that speech isn't drawn off top of the screen for a character that
  is nearby.




Server Fixes:

--Containment can transfer from actor to target through a transition.  For
  example, adding a full cart to a horse keeps what was contained in the cart
  in the new horse-drawn cart.

--Fixed server crash (and possible client crash) caused by improper clearing of
  removed sub-contained objects (post-data-update) if entire sub-container
  needed to be cleared out (if it contained nothing by now-removed objects).
  Someone had a basket in a cart containing nothing by domestic carrot seed
  heads.

--Forgot to include lookTime.db in server backups.

--Fixed initialization of look times if lookTimes.db empty.  All map cells are
  set to have look times of NOW.  This prevents them from being cleared if the
  server restarts again in less than 24 hours.

--Fixed a memory leak in naming phrases init.

--Removed duplicates from firstNames list (thanks Chard).




Version 70    2018-March-16

--Fixed a crash when setting down a baby just as someone feeds you.

--Fixed a crash when mousing over someone as they die.




Version 69    2018-March-16

--Scene editor now has 'V' fill function for repeating objects (useful to make
  stress-test maps).

--Fixed an invisible-self-as-baby bug when baby-self set down during map load.

--Fixed another baby bouncing-forever bug (if baby's clothing state changes
  while held, this causes a PU message about the baby, which the client was
  interpreting as a baby-drop, even though the server saw the baby as still
  held).

--Some bouncing-forever bugs seem to be caused by server missing or ignoring
  one of our MOVE messages, meaning that it never tells us we arrived, so our
  next action is pending forever.  I'm still working on figuring out what's
  going wrong in the server MOVE handling code.  In the mean time, I've added
  a work-around client-side that detects >4 seconds of bouncing and jumps back
  to the last known server position.

--Client using BUG protocol to report 4-second bouncing.

--Client support for NM names message and displaying names.

--Now showing YOUR in front of relation names.

--Client and server now differentiate between baby-drop PU messages and other
  PU messages about a held baby with done_moving field (only done_moving if
  baby no longer held).

--Fixed glitches in animation when dropping a baby.  On dropping player's
  client, the doing animation would run forever.  On witnessing players'
  clients, the doing animation wouldn't be triggered.




Server Fixes:

--Fixed comma int printing in stats at top of home page.

--Added hash table RAM caching of object database.

--Eliminated repeated calls to getTrans for same id in checkDecayContained.

--Eliminated expensive calls to checkDecayContained by tracking which cells on
  map have no decaying contained items.

--Fixed map file bloat by culling map of cells that haven't been looked at in
  24 hours and re-inserting remaining cells whenever a server restarts.
  Culled cells go back to their natural, procedurally-generated state.

--Server was setting timeout when polling for socket activity even when more
  buffered messages were potentially available, allowing messages to pile up.
  Fixed so that we don't sleep at all when polling sockets if we received at
  least one client message in the last loop.

--Support for BUG protocol to allow client to report bugs and trigger log
  snapshots.

--Support for baby and family naming phrases in SAY messages, and reporting
  names to client with NM messages.

--Eve say limit never below 30 characters to allow saying long family names.

--Fixed crash on server exit caused by lookTime db being closed first.

--Fixed mistaken sending of additional PU updates for a player after death if
  what they're holding or wearing decays.




Version 68    2018-March-16

--Fixed login FPS checking to wait 0.1 seconds for things to settle after load.
  https://github.com/jasonrohrer/OneLife/pull/14

--Fixed so that murder weapon creation sound plays even if something is left
  in grave by murder transition.

--Fixed object bank bug that wasn't saving slotVert setting correctly.

--Fixed sound played when swapping one container with another.

--Fixed so that there's no generic pickup sound played when what you're holding
  changes as the result of a player-caused transition that results in an
  on-the-ground creation sound.

--Fixed so that isSpriteSubset doesn't consider color (damp adobe wall is
  subset of adobe wall).

--Fixed hint result to prefer showing actor or target that becomes deeper (we
  don't want to see empty bucket as the result of pooring water on a wall).

--Mousing over a person shows their relationship to you, if any.



Server Fixes:

--Fixed bad PU message sent by server, causing client crash, if player spawns
  on top of something deadly and dies immediately.  I think this only caused a
  crash in solo-player servers, but might also have screwed other stuff up in
  multi-player servers.  https://github.com/jasonrohrer/OneLife/issues/12

--Can no longer eat when full.  https://github.com/jasonrohrer/OneLife/pull/11

--Murder weapon changes:  last use transition target can specify a custom grave
  marker for murder victim (separate from what is left on ground or in grave if
  attack misses, which is specified by non-last-use transtion), and this can
  also specify a special state that the murder weapon goes into if the attack
  is successful (bloody knife on hit vs regular knife on miss).  Permanent
  objects, if held, cannot be dropped.  Thus, a murder weapon can become
  undroppable for a period of time post-murder.

--Can now swap one container with another on right click.

--Server support for LI lineage message about all players alive when you are
  born and about new babies that are born.




Version 66    2018-March-14

--Pushed address space of temporary useDummy objects up to start at value
  in nextObjectNumber.txt to deal with case of largest-ID object getting
  removed.  useDummy IDs used to be based on maxID in bank, which would shrink
  when largest-ID object is removed.

--Got pick-up sound playing correctly when a container swap happens.

--Client plays held object creation sound when heldTransitionSourceID is 0
  (for scream sound when a bloody knife is created after killing).



Server Fixes:

--Added work-around for basket-full-of-zeros bug that causes a client crash. 
  Not sure how a container could ever have 0-IDs in it.  Code is in place to
  clean this up whenever the server encounters it in the future (and not send it
  on to the client).

--Improved behavior of container swap action (right click while holding
  something).  It now swaps with the bottom-most item in the container that is
  different from what you're holding.  If all items in the container are
  identical to what you're holding, it acts like a normal container add action.

--Server sets 0 for heldTransitionSourceID as a result of killing.

--Reflector full threshold reduced from 95% to 90% to reduce chance of SERVER
  FULL errors when a player is assigned a server by the reflector.



Version 65    2018-March-13

--Fixed a crash if held baby disconnects while we're walking with it.

--Fixed a few uninitialized values found with Valgrind.

--Detecting when vsync settings have changed.

--Fixed bug causing other person to mysteriously walk long distance through
  center of chunk when they were last seen on one side of map chunk but appear
  later on other side.

--Fixed math of path length measuring for partial paths (length is
  currentPathStep + 1, not currentPathStep).

--Client handles negative, zero, or tiny move ETAs without computing negative,
  infinite, or huge move speeds.  This is the source of the map desync bugs.

--After temp login, blank fields are show to avoid confusion.

--Fixed so that our own eating sound isn't played until we hear from server
  that we actually ate.

--Update process now detects write permission errors, rolls back, and displays
  an error message.

--Game no longer pauses when minimized (clearing paused screen was annoying).

--Fullscreen borderless mode available (change with borderless.ini in
  settings folder---be careful, it's experimental).

--Fixed the baby-bouncing-forever bug, finally.




Server Fixes:

--With the server load fixes, seems safe to push population cap up to 60.

--Back down to 40.

--Server wasn't setting responsible player for container-remove action, causing
  container to appear emptied before responsible player finished walking there.

--Temporarily rolled back partial-map-chunk server load fix while I fix the
  client/server map sync bug.

--Server log.txt getting big.  Changed to make backup and rotate every 3 days.

--Saved serverOut.txt getting big, added a log rotator.

--Server now gives current mid-path possition in first playerUpdate for moving
  players instead of starting them at their start location along their paths.

--Server should never send negative values for move time remaining.

--Partial-map-chunk sending turned back on, given other fixes.

--Right-click to now puts held at top of container's stack and grabs bottom
  item.  Useful for cycling through what's in a container.





Version 64    2018-March-9

--Improved display of error message if game folder is read-only.

--Buttons no longer clicked if we drag into them (if press starts elsewhere).

--Fixed Editor pickers not to register clicks for presses that start elsewhere.

--Fixed double-sound play when use-dummy object with using sound transitions
  into something else (example:  shallow well into deep well).

--Fixed so that floor hugging code only duplicates botttom layer of neighboring
  floor (so that bear skin rug isn't duplicated oddly against a wall).

--Fixed ground tile cache to put unknown tile at 99999 instead of numbering
  them after the last known biome (when future biomes added, the old numbering
  causes collisions).

--Fixed bug in copying old chunk contained and subcontained over when a new
  map chunk is received by client.




Source Fixes:

--Fixed to flush caches after data update in live source distribution.




Server Fixes:

--Now support emails that use the + character.

--URL encoding fixed so that 0-9 and ~ are not encoded characters.

--Server update scripts now interleave updates in batches of servers, even 
  first, then odd.  This keeps half the servers online throughout most of the
  update process.

--Chasing animals now attempt exact distance to closest target instead of
  overshooting.

--Max players per server 60 instead of 200 just to be safe.  Saw some lag.

--Reflector report now shows totals at bottom.

--Improved the compile notes with more details.

--Launch is over.  No more Mr. Nice Guy.  Eating bonus dropping to 2 (was 3).

--Thermal model improved.  Heat around you is computed from scratch each time
  you stop moving, instead of building up incrementally with memory of previous
  heat maps from previous moves.  This fixes the "walking back and forth on a
  floor" heat explosion bug.  The heat map around a player was reduced from
  16x16 to 10x10, and the simulation is run for 2x more cycles.  This is
  slightly more efficient, and it also allows for more heat build-up, given
  that the heat system no longer has memory.

--Support for biomes with positive or negative heat values.

--Max players down to 40 per server until I fix lag.

--Mr. Nice Guy is back.  Eating bonus back to 3.

--Fixed so that carried-baby speech is delivered correctly after long parent
  walks.

--Implemented map chunk overlap detection.  When sending a new map chunk to the
  client, we avoid re-sending (or looking up) the tiles that overlap with the
  previous chunk that we sent that client.  This results in a 46% reduction in
  dbGet calls, a 65% performance increase for the map chunk lookup code, and a
  53% reduction in map message size, when walking back and forth on a
  container-filled test map.

--Server now skips check for heat-producing contained items around player when
  computing player's thermal map.  This was consuming substantial server
  resources.

--Reflector now uses read timeout with each server to avoid hanging
  indefinitely if a server answers but does not send data.

--Server now handles unexpected responses from ticket server (like 504 Gateway
  errors) without keeping a new connection in the loop forever.




Version 60    2018-February-28

--Fixed cannot-move-after-speaking bug on Mac by making E-click
  right-mouse-click alternative off by default (there's now a settings file).

--Replaced AppleScript System Events with Finder for MacOS find-the-folder
  work-around at first start-up (because System Events stops running on
  certain recent versions of MacOS).

--Changed Mac App bundle name to include version number as a work-around for
  failed updates on the Mac.




Server Fixes:

--Added commas to big numbers in homepage life stats.




Version 59     2018-February-27

--Fixed a crash when holding a baby and you get fed by someone else, and a few
  other situations when holding a baby.



Server Fixes:

--Nursing cost now 1 instead of (was 2 + floor(babyAge) ).

--Baby birth cost now 0 (was 10).

--Plus 2 food bonus on all food eaten (everything provides 2 more food).

--Several server settings are now reloaded each time a new player joins instead
  of only at server restart.

--Added script for cloning live settings to all servers from git repo.

--Food bonus up to 3 for now.

--Fixed a server crash when a moving object moves away just as a user action
  happens.

--Changed server update script to shut down servers one at a time so that
  people can keep playing during the update.




Version 58     2018-February-26

--Hiding email and account key after first successful login (to protect privacy
  of streamers).




Version 53     2018-February-25

--Fixed layer order changes in object editor to work with extra animations. 

--Added support for sprite layers that pop into existence during animation
  transitions.  If the fade for the layer is marked as fully hard, a visibility
  pop will happen.  Otherwise, the visibility fades like it used to.

--Import editor always shows crosshairs, even during select.

--Added control over phase of animation pauses with animation start pause time.
  Now possible to make pistons that pump one at a time, down the line.

--Fixed behavior of value sliders in editor when held mouse moves in and out of
  slider bar.

--Support for forcing number of significant figures on value sliders, and using
  extra digits for animation pause times.

--Added display of current sprite position in editor.

--Support for animations that always start at frame zero after transition,
  instead of continuing from frame where previous object, pre-transition, left
  off.

--Scene editor now displays object ID of current cell.

--Fixed bug in animation speed for moving objects.

--Fixed quit confirmation box to no longer be titled with PAUSED.

--Fixed editor so that containable containers have slot demo button visible.

--Fixed bug in hint system that was showing hints for generic one-time-use
  transtions as bare ground tranitions.



Server Fixes:

--Added transition failure log.

--Fixed server scripts that loop over remote servers with ssh in the loop
  (ssh was breaking the loop's file read operation, ssh -n fixes it).





Version 51     2018-February-8

--Added EQ to cut extreme low end and high end from recorded sound effects.

--Fixed hint system's handling of default transitions.  For example, goose pond
  now shows proper hint list, even though touching the pond with most objects
  causes the pond to temporarily transition (goose jumps in).

--Object editor shows F label when current sprite layer is flipped.

--Baking an object can now handle sprite flips properly.

--Fixed default object values when trimming a large sprite.

--Support for an extra x,y offset animation parameter per layer.

--Enabled 45-degree and zero buttons for vertical slot rotation in editor.

--Fixed with a hack so that clothing that has a held animation that includes
  rotation (which is applied when worn too) is more clickable (the click area
  used to be based on its un-rotated location, which didn't match its visual
  location).  The hack is not perfect and doesn't account for sprite parent
  relationships or x/y animation offsets, but it can be improved later if
  needed.

--Added support in editor for object layer moves that ignore parent links and
  copy/paste of difference from saved for a given layer.



Server Fixes:

--Fixed so that multi-use food sources (bites of pie) make it into food log
  properly.  Thanks Yvanhooe.




Version 48     2018-January-26

--Fixed log error message when downloading updates.

--Fixed randomization of client choice of multiple download update mirrors.

--Fixed crash in editor when loading an manipulating a transition with a
  negative actor.

--No longer playing using sound when a target object with no creation sound 
  goes through a use-dummy transition.  Still playing the using sound if the
  held tool changes with no creation sound (example:  bowl of water filled at
  pond plays only water bowl creation sound, while dumping bowl back into pond
  plays pond using sound).

--Hint for eventual outcome now shown when holding a partially-used object
  (example:  eating a pie gives you a plate eventually).  Hints for partially
  used object in general were disabled by mistake before.





Server Fixes:

--Old bad mother limit started at 2 and grew with population.  New limit 
  started at 1 and grew with pop/3.  Fixed it to start at 2.






Version 47     2018-January-22

--Auto-inherit closest on-screen home marker location when entering the world.
  Thus, babies can have a home, even though they aren't old enough to set one.

--0-y-old babies now revert to crying every time they speak.





Version 44     2018-January-19

--Sounds no longer play with slight random pitch variations.  This was causing 
  an unpleasant phaser-ish sound quality.

--Scene editor now allows automated time/age playing.

--Scene editor now allows starting and stopping of recording frames.

--Fixed baby held animation in scene editor.

--Fixed invisible baby bug.

--Fixed baby bad pathfinding bug after jumping out of arms.




Server Fixes:

--Bad mother limit now grows with population at 1/3 the old rate.

--New child-spacing algorithm based on a randomly chosen birth cooldown time
  for each mother.

--Babies born with 4 hunger bars instead of 2, but start out with only 2 full.

--Only females of fertile age can nurse babies.

--No more 1:1 food transfer from mother to baby when nursing.  Instead, there
  is a one-time pick-up cost of (baby's age + 2), and keeping baby fed is free
  after that, until baby is put back down.  Before, a nursing woman consumed
  food twice as fast while holding a baby (feeding two people with one hunger
  bar), which was too frantic.  

--No longer giving baby to most well-fed eligible woman on server.  Instead,
  picking a woman from a weighted distribution of all eligible women othe
  server based on how well-fed they are.  Thus, a hungry woman can have a baby
  sometimes.  Thanks Jared J.

--Fixed so that reverse use transition, that happen on a timer, can un-use
  object step by step instead of all the way back to parent object (example:
  berries on bush can grow back one berry at a time instead of all at once).




Version 42     2018-January-9

--Fixed game playback issue with aysnchronous file reads.

--Fixed the way that auto-generated code dependency files are handled.

--Support for floor usage sounds that override footstep sounds when an object
  is over a floor tile (wood floors can now have wooden footstep sounds that
  override default footstep sounds).

--Support for sounds that have multiple sub-sounds that are picked from at
  random whenever the sound plays.  For example, footstep variation (so
  footsteps aren't soo repetative sounding).

--Fixed so that moving animation sounds played for moving objects.

--Fixed movement glitch when holding down mouse outside a completely enclosed
  area with no path out. 

--Pasting animation sounds from person onto non-person now correctly clears
  sound age range.

--Sound reverbs no longer play in editor.  Better to hear raw sounds.

--Fixed client base move speed to compensate for new server 3.75 speed.

--Fixed bug in sound Paste All in animation editor.

--Animation editor can now copy/paste sounds from all animation types at once.

--Holding mouse to keep moving now treats mouse release as one final click.
  You walk to where you finally release the mouse.

--Fixed hold-to-move so that it works even when mouse is close to player.
  It does this by automatically extending the chosen path in the same
  direction.  This prevents a bunch of very short paths from being sent to the
  server.

--Fixed so that clicking on an unreachable object walks you as close as
  possible to it.  Before, it would result in no motion at all.

--Fixed autologin crash when email and account key not set.  Thanks tomberek.

--Editor and transition bank can now specify decays that are multiple epochs
  long.

--Fixed glitch in arm position when non-handheld object used on another object
  and no transition applies.

--Mousing over items in a container now changes tool tip text (to show you what
  item will be removed on right-click).

--Mousing over clothing, or items contained in clothing, now changes tool tip.

--Mousing over bare skin while holding edible now shows EAT tooltip.

--Fixed so that invisible-when-worn parts of clothing don't get moused-over
  when clothing is worn.

--Frame rate measuring and vsync detection/warning only happens on first run
  now, with results saved to settings folder.

--Display target frame rate and vsync mode on Settings screen, with button to
  re-detect.

--Fixed so that player death handled instantly even when game is paused.  Fixed
  so that final displayed age is age provided by server, not age updated with
  local clock (so if player dies while machine is asleep and receives death
  message later, proper death age will be displayed).  Also fixes problem with
  59-year rounding issue.  Thanks tomberek.

--Improved efficiency of message input buffers.

--Fixed broken game state on next life when player dies while pending messages
  are still in the queue.

--Added compression of all large message to protocol with new CM (compressed
  message) wrapper message type.

--Finally fixed the frozen baby after drop bug.

--Fixed bug in mid-path-step calculation when in-progress move for another
  player is almost done when we first learn about it.





Server Fixes:

--Base movement speed is now 3.75 tiles per second instead of 4 tiles per
  second to ensure that client camera moves at a whole number of pixels (8) per
  frame at 60 fps.  Modified speeds (due to age or carrying things) are also
  rounded to ensure a whole number of pixels per frame, or in the case of very
  slow speeds, a whole number of frames per pixel.
 
--Fixed so that in-progress player moves are no longer reported to client when
  a new map chunk is sent to the client.  We're reporting moves with a radius
  of 32, and our chunks have a radius of 16, so the client has already heard
  about any moves starting around the map chunk.  This fixes a glitch in other
  player movement when their move ends in a new chunk as the observing player
  moves along.

--Fixed bug in life stats processing across multiple game servers.

--Fixed so that all crontab scripts run with bash.  FoodStats update was
  broken otherwise.

--Distroying a container now causes the contents to be scattered on the ground
  around where the container used to be (they used to just disappear).
  Example:  picking up a grave with a basket to make a basket of bones no
  longer makes the contents of the grave disappear.

--Fixed map generation so that fractals are centered around 0,0 to make testing
  scale factor easier.

--Shrunk map scale by a factor of 3 and cut map scale increase factor
  associated with additional biomes in half.  Local biome areas are now
  smaller, and you have to walk less far to find a biome boundary.  This makes
  the landscape generally more interesting.

--Shrunk map density variation scale by a factor of 4.  The empty regions of
  the map are now much smaller.

--Support for sped up and frozen map transition times for testing.

--Can no longer close a vertically-oriented door on top of someone who is
  standing still in that spot.

--Fixed so that non-moving player is still killed by old age.  We check all
  ages every server step.  Age-death time is more accurate now, because server
  sleep is shortened if an age-related death is near.

--Fixed crash when newly connected player errors before first PU message is
  sent to them.

--Improved efficiency of message input buffers.

--Stress testing server revealed that fractal map algorithm was producing the
  most CPU load.  Added caching of the fractal map (with a memory cost of 768 
  KiB), reducing this load by 10x.  Now database queries are the primary load,
  as they should be.

--Fixed to close client connection if writing to their socket ever fails (for
  example, if their write buffer is full).  Before, there was undefined
  behavior client-side when partial protocol messages came through if the
  server was under heave load and its write buffers were full.

--Fixed child race selection to not wrap around.

--Reflector now seeds random generator with player's email instead of IP.

--Moved main server to separate Linode.  Reflector now handles all game servers
  as remote servers.

--Backup script now includes remote server lifeLogs and also foodLogs.




Version 40     2017-December-1

--Old object's using sound now played when a player causes an object on the
  ground to change, and the new object has no creation sound (example: digging
  up a home marker produces a skewer, which has no creation sound, so the home
  marking using sound is played).

--Fixed death marker checkbox in editor to not hide a few other checkboxes,
  simplifying the widget visibility calculation in the editor.

--Replaced finicky auto-HOME system with player-settable homeMarker objects.
  Thanks Paul V.

--hardToQuit mode now hides buttons on rebirth choice page.  autoLogin support.
  Preparing game for being show in public.




Version 39     2017-November-29

--Fixed git handling of .txt line endings on Windows.

--Fixed unix2dos conversion program behavior on Windows.

--Back to old camera movement.  It's jumpier, but doesn't let you get so
  annoyingly close to the edge of the screen.  Thanks Casey C. and Jared J.

--Replaced piano hunger sound with ukulele A-minor chord so that it stands out
  from the piano music.




Version 37     2017-November-28

--Windows can't handle pointers larger than 32x32, which caused a crash in
  bigPointer support on large displays when we tried to load a 40x40 cursor.
  Thanks Erik O.

--Fixed login error if you hit ENTER to leave the email field.  Thanks Erik O.

--Click-to-drop now highlights target square of drop.  Thanks Casey C.

--Fixed OGG player to handle mono OGG files (was only playing in L channel).

--Added an automatic HOME compass (based on area where you conducted the most
  activity).  Thanks Paul V.

--Improved camera to not move at all if player is moving around center of
  screen.  Thanks Bennett F.

--Spell check of object descriptions in editor.




Server Fixes:

--Food capacity decays down to 4 at old age instead of 2.

--Clothing speed multiplier applies when clothing is worn (but not when riding
  something else).

--Each character now has their own speed multiplier (some people can be faster
  or slower).  Thanks Mez.

--Improved bad mother detection in low-population situations.  A lone Eve now
  only needs to have two babies die before a new Eve is spawned.  The bad
  mother threashold increases from 2 up to 10 dead babies as the server
  population increases.




Version 35     2017-November-15

--Sub-containers, one-level deep (basket in a cart) now supported.

--Creation sound no longer played with an object moves.

--Fixed so that not just short human-made objects are mouse-through-able, but
  all short objects.  So if you build a wall in front of a rock, you can still
  mouse through to the rock.

--Fixed arm position when other players pick something up.

--Fixed stutter-step of other players during long, continuous movements.

--Optimized sprite drawing code with profiler to increase maximum number of 
  sprites that can be drawn per frame.

--More improvements to the way object center offsets are computed to be used
  for held positions.  Now true visible sprite width (instead of total image
  width) is used, and 90 degree rotations are accounted for.  This fixes the
  held position of the basket of bones, for example, which contains a wide
  sprite that is rotated vertically.

--Fixed pickers in editor to not need to reset results page number when some
  results potentially deleted on another editor screen.  All editor screens
  now hold their picker pages when flipping back and forth between screens.
  Pickers now automatically rewind back past empty results pages.

--Temperature arrow positions now rounded to whole pixels.

--Fixed bug in way objectHeight calculation made use of sprite anchor offsets.

--Fixed so that target fps is chosen from list of possible fps in settings file,
  even if vsync isn't enforcing that fps.

--Pathfinding fixed to prevent walking through a door in your grid square after
  it has been closed in front of you.

--Fixed to prevent click-through of short objects behind short objects 
  (example:  open door that partially overlaps nearby wall, wall should not be
  able to click through door to hit wall).

--Fixed so that camera-settle speed takes FPS into account (before, it took too
  long to settle at lower fps after the player stops moving).

--Fixed so that only one sound plays during a transition, even if something new
  is created in the player's hand and on the ground.  The ground object's
  creation sound takes priority.

--Fixed to avoid clicking on objects during continued, mouse-held-down walking.

--Fixed misclick issue when clicking on objects near the edge of the screen.

--Fixed case where continous walking mode cancelled after mousing over a clump 
  of blocking objects.

--Fixed so that held object can produce heat.  Contained and sub-contained
  objects now can produce heat as well, shielded by the r-value of their
  container.  Items contained in clothing can produce heat, shielded by
  clothing r-value.

--Support for floors.

--Support for extra animation slots (for use in trailer animations).

--Support for live animation triggers in game client (for trailer).

--Fixed other player wiggle direction on first action caused by uninitialized
  value.

--Fixed so that newly-added player doesn't get drawn until all their sprites
  are loaded.

--Eve's camp location only remembered if Eve dies of old age (for that same
  player to spawn there the next time they play Eve).  If Eve dies younger than
  that, that player will respawn in a random location in their next Eve life.
  Repeat suicide is no longer a viable solo player strategy.

--Fixed animation blending when a moving object comes to rest.

--Fixed frozen rotation frame count use in animation editor.

--Drawing grid square highlights when holding something (to show you where it 
  will be put down).

--Fixed youth body position on rideable objects.

--Fixed poor cornering and endless circling at high movement speeds.

--Fixed overshooting at very high movement speeds.  Speed multiplier of 10 is
  now useable, and 20 is borderline useable.

--Support for container slots having a parent sprite so that they move and
  rotate with that parent sprite.

--Fixed creation-sound-playing code that checks if newly created object is a
  sprite-sub-set of the source object so that it allows for global
  transpositions of the sub-sprites (example:  picking up froe from pile of
  boards should not play froe creation sound).

--Fixed display of animation for held object in animation editor.

--Added scene editor and support for test maps on server.

--Anim editor now shows test ground sprite when showing a still person with a
  held object.

--Fixed so that arrow keys have no effect on invisible cursor position when
  typing a chat message on note paper.

--Fixed glitch in pasting from clipboard on Linux.  Now uses xclip to avoid 
  X Windows event issues.

--Support for editing and submitting game reviews from inside game client.




Server fixes:

--Food log now outputs every hour regardless of whether players are eating at
  the turn of the hour.

--Server can now load a test map from a file that overrides the proc-gen map.

--New Eve placement that tracks most recent camp separately for each player.
  New solo players are placed randomly in the wilderness.  Repeat solo Eves
  are returned to their last camp.

--Food log report includes past month.

--Fixed so that Eve placement radii don't grow beyond 1024 if a player 
  continues to die young repeatedly.  They used to double until 32-bit overflow.





Version 32     2017-August-15

--Fixed assumption that time() returns 32-bit int values (see server fixes
  for details).

--On screens larger than 1920x1080, or if settings/forceBigPointer.ini set,
  double-sized mouse pointer is used.

--New death reason:  Nursing Starvation.

--New noise graphic to draw outside of known map regions during server lag.

--Now all short human-made or human-moveable objects are mouse-able when they
  are covered up by a foreground object. 

--Fixed vertical cross-over point for player feet when walking between cells
  to reduce the appearance of objects passing through their legs.

--Added foot-cross-over guide mark in object editor.

--Added edit-time computation of object pixel heights.  Using this in server 
  natural map generation to avoid placing short objects behind tall objects.

--Fixed animation editor glitches when speed mult < 1.0

--Moving animals.

--Fixed overlap issues for people moving in same cell.

--You can now feed anyone, regardless of age.

--Eating animation and eating sound played when someone is fed.

--Fixed glitches when a moving parent dies while carrying you.

--Support for using non-human-deadly objects at a distance (e.g., for hunting 
  animals).

--Fixed editor crash when testing clothing position.

--Parent/Child buttons in animation editor to make limb animation easier.

--Copy All in animation editor now makes sure destination sprites match source
  sprites during paste.
 
--Clothing now goes into its held animation instead of ground animation when 
  wearer stops moving.

--Support for demo scenery in animation editor so we can test moving object
  foot visibility behind non-blocking objects.

--Added horizontal swap buttons in transition editor.






Server fixes:

--Fixed a typo that was causing a crash.

--Fixed assumption that time() returns 32-bit int values.  In fact, the C 
  standard says nothing about the time_t type.  It is not even safe to
  subtract one time() value from another.  Completely overhauled my time
  implementation to assume nothing beyond what is specified in the C standard,
  now measuring time as a double-precision floating point number of seconds 
  from my own epoch, which fixes the year 2038 problem in a standards-compliant
  way for 285 million years into the future.
  (Note:  the year 2038 problem is only fixed on platforms where the 
   time.h time() function works beyond year 2038... for example NOT 32-bit
   Linux.  On broken platforms, there is no way to measure time beyond 2038.)

--Storing time values in database as 64-bit floats (doubles).  Added a new
  mapTime.db database to support this without doubling the rest of the
  database size (time values are stored in a separate, double-wide database).

--New baby is given to the most well-fed fertile woman on the server (still
  observing the 2-living-child-max rule and bad mother rule). 

--Giving birth now takes 10 out of mother's food supply, with a min remaining 
  food of 4.

--Nursing a baby now transfers food from the mother's store to the baby's
  store.  This adds a new death reason:  Nursing Starvation.  Picking up a
  baby always consumes at least one food, so a good baby will wait until they
  need food before asking.  Nursing is still more efficient than hand-feeding
  because the food transfer fits the baby perfectly (where as a berry has a
  tendency to over-feed, beyond the size of the baby's stomach, thus wasting 
  food).

--Fixed bug that could cause a walking player who dies to appear at their
  destination after death.

--Life stats script now works incrementally only on latest log files.

--Server life log now records parent chain length for each birth.

--Fixed bug in server life log that caused log file to be reopened repeatedly.

--Added hourly food logging support to server.

--Food stats report for website.

--Fixed server-side bug that was causing object creation sounds to sometimes
  play when they are removed from a container.




Version 30     2017-July-28

--Fixed UnixSource build process to not overwrite user's custom settings.

--Fixed socket handling to detect send errors.

--Recording window minimized status (to handle alt-tabbing in recordings).

--LOGIN message is now a fixed length regardless of email address so that
  playback of recordings works on machines with a different email.ini setting.

--Fixed hint-related crash when picking up a baby.

--Added info about what you just ate when you drank breast milk.

--Fixed editor crash when editing an empty category.

--Fixed so that measured, set frame rate is included in recording header
  (recording doesn't start until after frame rate is measured).  This ensures 
  proper playback of games recorded at non-60fps frame rates.

--Fixed two memory leaks.

--When mousing over something dropped behind another object, highlight now
  shows through the blocking object.

--Drop-behind mousability now applies to objects dropped by other players in
  your vacinity, as well as objects changed (but not dropped).  It is limited
  to objects that are less than one tile tall (to prevent annoying click-
  through on trees that are behind other trees).

--Fixed to play useDummy using target sounds (even though target changes).

--Support for reverse-use transitions (example:  putting clay back in clay pit).

--Distinction between lastUse transition for actor and target.

--Support for use-appear sprites in addition to use-vanish sprites (example:
  wear marks on axe).

--Fixed so that mouse highlighting works for objects that are three tiles
  below mouse instead of just two.

--Fixed so that music doesn't drop out for sake of hunger sounds at very end
  of old age life.  There are no audible hunger sounds to interrupt the music
  at that point.

--You can now feed/cloth the elderly (over age 55) just like you can for a
  baby (under age 5).




Server fixes:

--Fixed glitch in reported baby food capacity when baby is fed.

--Changed so that Eve radius only expanded if 10 Eves die under age 16 with no
  Eve living past 20 in the process. 

--Eve placement based on previous object placements now weights objects based
  on their depth in the tech tree.  So more advanced objects count more when
  finding a camp to put Eve into.

--Shrunk default Eve placement radius from 20 down to 2 so finding the camp is
  easier.

--Bad mother problem solved by not giving a mother more babies if they have
  already had more than 10 babies and all of them are already dead.

--Support for server-wide epoch time that can be specified in auto-decay
  transitions with an auto-decay value of -1.  Thus, the epoch time can be
  adjusted with a server setting globally instead of needing to edit all the
  transition times.

--Fixed to avoid randomizing decay time of map objects that are set by players.
  Naturally-occurring objects still have their decay times set randomly the
  first time they are seen (to avoid lock-step with identical objects in the
  same area).  Now fires burn the same duration every time, and ember-making
  isn't so time-finicky.

--Fixed so you cannot put things back into a grave.

--Fixed so that we stop polling a socket once a player dies, even though we 
  keep the socket open to allow them to receive their death message, to avoid
  poll busy-looping on a closed socket in the event of a disconnection.

--Fixed a memory leak if server is quit before connection is closed to a dead
  player.

--Server now has all players look at the map around them periodically to keep
  decaying objects in a live state (so that we keep decay cycling them).
  Before, objects with longer decays would stop transitioning on the player's
  screen while the player was statnding still.




Version 28     2017-July-21     

--Other player action animations no longer interrupt their walking if the 
  action message arrives before we see them finish their walk locally.

--Improved sprite trimming algorithm (used to tile large sprites to reduce
  pixel fill) to eliminate visible seams along tile boundaries by cross-fading
  tiles.

--Changed the way that actions of other players are handled, greatly increasing
  the smoothness of other player's motions and actions.  We now play other
  player's walking paths at our own rate and defer actions that should
  happen at the end of their walk (like picking something up) until after
  our local version of their walk has completed.  This means that the 
  truth as it exists on the server can play back with a time delay locally,
  but it will mesh up better with the walking actions we've received
  from the server (why show them pick something up if we haven't even
  shown them get there yet?  It looks weird, even if it's closer to the truth.
  This means that slightly more often, we'll go to grab an object that
  another player has already grabbed, and our client will know that it has
  been grabbed but won't show it yet because the other player isn't finished
  walking yet.  We'll be surprised when we fail to pick up the object and
  the other player gets it instead.  But this was possible before too,
  due to network latency.  Now we have an additional opportunity for it
  caused by local animation consistency latency.

--Fixed "forever flying" object pick-ups when we walk away after pick-up by
  gradually speeding the object up the longer it has been in the air, so
  it quickly catches up to us as we walk away.

--Fixed potential crash when the player holding you dies.

--Fixed circling forever at end of short paths by going directly toward final
  spot if we detect that too many steps have occurred.

--Pathmarking code now accounts for diagonal path steps.

--Support for making objects that are permanent and drawn behind player without
  blocking walking (e.g., roads).

--Fixed visual round-off errors at high coordinate values by offsetting all
  coordinates from our starting location before using them as to-draw positions
  (32 bit floats cannot represent large coordinates with enough precision).

--Map pull mode now auto-logs-in.

--Death screen now shows age and cause of death.

--Category system in editor to make abstract transitions that apply to a class
  of objects.

--Unix Source bundle now ships as a script that pulls from live source 
  repositories.

--Permanent, non-holdable objects can be food, allowing you to eat from them
  without setting down the tool in your hand.

--Eating food now stacks instead of filling you to a pre-defined per-food 
  maximum.  Eating one berry might fill you up to 4, but eating two in a row
  would fill you up to 8.

--Split ground overlay into 4 1024x1024 tiles to deal with bug in larger mipmap
  generation on some graphics cards.

--NumUses system for objects that auto-generates intermediary objects and 
  transitions.  Example:  a berry bush can have a berry picked from it 10 
  times before becoming empty, and berry sprites can disappear from it along 
  the way.  The intermediary objects are replaced with unused versions of the 
  main object at server shutdown.

--Fixed way object ancestor cycle is detected so that kindling creation sound
  plays when long shaft is chopped into kinding.

--Support for generic use transitions.  Full water bottle can become an empty
  water bottle whenever it is successfully used (no longer have to define
  that it becomes empty in each and every situation).

--Fixed bug in min priority heap implementation that was resulting in
  badly ordered priorities.

--Music fades so that hungry sound can be heard.

--Using sound for target, unchanged object played in case where our held
  object changes (example:  putting clay back into deposit, dumping water back
   in pond).





Server fixes:

--Fixed hiccup in parent animation when we're being carried long distances due
  to unneeded player updates mid-move when we reach a new map chunk.

--Fixed disappearing baby when you click on your clothes when holding a baby.
  (You now cannot remove your clothes while holding a baby.)  Thanks Josh C.

--Reflector now seeds random number generator with your IP address.  Repeat
  suicide and reconnection won't send you to different servers.

--Added sane behavior at actual edges of world instead of letting player walk
  off edge and cause a crash.





Version 27     2017-July-1

--Content update.




Version 26     2017-July-1

--Fixed server crash when baby jumps out of arms.

--Fixed bug in logging age at time of death.L

--Better logging of failed client connections.

--Piano note sound to indicate start of starvation, repeats on last hunger bar.

--Highlighting object under mouse.

--Fixed crash when pathfinding or clicking off edge of known map (in case of 
  server lag).

--Fixed a few uninitialized values found with Valgrind.

--New Eve placement method (random within radius around largest old camp).

--Clicking on empty ground cell containing a blocking object no longer counts
  as a click on that object.  Reduces surprise tree clicks.

--Dropped items that you're standing in front of are no longer clickable 
  through your body.

--Right clicking a holdable object while holding another object causes them
  to swap.  Can easily swap what you're holding with something else.

--Other player's eating sounds now play.

--After dying, upon getting reborn, whole connection process started from 
  scratch.  This insures that you will find out about a backup server if
  the main server has crashed (which may have caused your death).

--Time no longer halts during pause (server messages used to pile up during
  pause and play back all at once with wild results).

--Improved the way clothing R-values are summed, adding a weight for each body 
  part.  A hat is now more important than a shoe, and a really insulating shoe
  cannot make you overheat.

--Changed heat propagation to use eight weighted neighbor cells.

--Reduced number of heat propagation simulation cycles to slow heat changes.

--Mac build now defaults to windowed mode.

--Added code to tell Windows that we are handling our own scaling.

--Fixed game recording on Windows.

--Switched to GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP instead of gluBuild2DMipmaps on platforms
  that support it (gluBuild2DMipmaps was crashing on one particular mac).
