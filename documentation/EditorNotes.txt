===TRANSITION EDITOR====

Transition block represents

    ACTOR  +  TARGET
           =
NEW ACTOR  +  NEW TARGET



==Moving Objects==

To specify what is left behind by a moving object, set ACTOR and NEW TARGET
to moving object (or before/after objects of move transition) and set
NEW ACTOR to what is left behind by moving object.

If moving object can consume an object that it moves onto, set TARGET as well.

Thus, a moving object can have distinct effects based on whether it is moving
into an empty space (bare ground) or moving onto an object that it can consume.



==Murder==
Handheld objects with Deadly Distance > 0 can be used to murder.

Put any person in the TARGET of the transition to indicate a generic on-person
transition.

The weapon is the ACTOR and NEW ACTOR is what ends up in the murderer's hand
afterward, whether or not the murder missed (example:  empty bow).

NEW TARGET is what ends up on the ground or in the grave afterward (example: 
arrow).


Last Use on the TARGET side indicates that NEW TARGET is a special grave
(example: bloody grave) and NEW ACTOR is what's left in the hand after a 
successful murder (example:  bloody bow).

So these two transitions together indicate what happens if the murder attempt
hits or misses.

Last Use on the ACTOR side indicates that NEW TARGET is what the victim
ends up holding if the murder connects (example:  wound blood).
