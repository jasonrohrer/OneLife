Paper masking process:

1.  Scan paper piece with desired edges (torn, etc) on black background

2.  Levels with black @48 and white @232

3.  Duplicate twice (call White and Black)

4.  Use Curves to isolate almost white and almost black pixels on layers from 3.

5.  New transparent layer, called Cleanup.

6.  Paint over almost-white/black pixels with solid white/black paint in
    layer from 5.

7.  Merge Cleanup layer with leveled layer from 2.  This makes a mask.

8.  Scan a solid piece of paper for texture (graph paper, not paper, etc).

9.  Mask paper texture with mask from 7 to get a cut-out version of it.

10.  Make solid black layer and mask it with same mask.

11.  Blur black with radius 13, set layer opacity to 86% for shadow.
     (Smaller slips use blur radius 7 with opacity 66% for shadow).


Font process:

1.  Scan black font on white paper.

2.  Levels with white point @ 239

3.  Duplicate and apply Curves with _| shape to isolate almost-white points.

4.  New trans layer, and paint white paint over almost-white points.

5.  Merge 4 onto result of 2.

6.  Invert.
