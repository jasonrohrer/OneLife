I'm Jason Rohrer, solo dev of One Hour One Life and 18 other games over 14 years.  AMA!



Hey folks, I've been making video games as a solo developer for the past 14 years as a full-time gig, and supporting my family doing it.  During that time, I shipped 19 games of various shapes and sizes.

My latest game, One Hour One Life, is a multiplayer survival game of parenting and civilization building.  Get born to another player as your mother.  Live an entire life in one hour.  Have babies of your own in the form of other players.  Leave a legacy for the next generation as you help to rebuild civilization from scratch.  This trailer should help explain it:

Along the way, I started a religion, got a game in the MOMA, created the longest game title in Nintend DS cartridge history, buried an $8000 titanium board game in the Nevada desert for 2000 years, and created a legal demonic gambling game that saw over $75,000 in player wagers.

I just turned 41.  My oldest child (out of three) is almost 16 years old.  Yikes.  AMA!
