# Keep this simple to solve the current problem.
# In the Windows build process, we convert .txt files to DOS line endings
# those are the only files that are converted.  For this to work, the .txt
# files MUST have Unix line endings in the working directory.

*.txt    text eol=lf


# QCad DXF files are being saved with CRLF
# leave them alone.
*.dxf    binary
*.bat    binary

# some windows-specific files
icon.rc                         binary
makeWindowsExtractor_template   binary


# Note that source files and .ini files, etc. will be auto-converted to CRLF
# line endings on Windows, but that doesn't seem to cause a problem, currently.
