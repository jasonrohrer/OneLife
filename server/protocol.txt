Messages in ascii.

Terminated by # character


NOTE:

Wherever an object_id is menioned (o_id, new_id, etc), it can be either
a single ASCII-base-10 integer, OR a comma-delimited list of integers.

The first one is the base object ID (can be 0 if no object there),
and subsequent IDs are the objects contained in that object


HMAC_SHA1 below is the SHA-1 based HMAC as defined in RFC 2104, with the
resulting hash in hex-encoded ASCII.
The parameters are as follows:

char *HMAC_SHA1( char *inKey, char *inData )




Shutdown mode:

If the server is in shutdown mode (no new connections allowed), upon 
receiving a client connection, the server will immediately send the following
message:

SHUTDOWN
current_players/max_players
#

All further messages from the client will be ignored.



Server full

If the server is full, (no new connections allowed), upon 
receiving a client connection, the server will immediately send the following
message:

SERVER_FULL
current_players/max_players
#

All further messages from the client will be ignored.



Client login proceedure.

1.  Upon receiving a client connection, the server will immediately send
    a sequence number to the client in the following format:
    
SN
current_players/max_players
challenge_string
required_version_number
#

Where challenge_string is an ascii string, less than 150 characters long.





2.  The client MUST respond with the following login message:

LOGIN email password_hash account_key_hash tutorial_number twin_code_hash twin_count#


password_hash is based on the server access password, and is computed by:

HMAC_SHA1( password, challenge_string )


account_key_hash is based on the client's account key, all uppercase with
hyphens removed, and is computed by:

HMAC_SHA1( account_key, challenge_string )


tutorial_number specifies the tutorail map number to load, or 0 for normal game.


twin_code_hash is optional.  The sha1 hash of the twin code.

twin_count is mandatory if twin_code_hash is present.  How many twins are in
the party, total.



3.  The server responds with one of:

ACCEPTED
#

-or-

REJECTED
#

-or-

NO_LIFE_TOKENS
REJECTED
#


After ACCEPTED, normal client-server messaging commences.

After REJECTED, the server will close the connection to the client.





Each message from server is prefaced by a type tag.

Possible types include:

COMPRESSED_MESSAGE (CM)

MAP_CHUNK  (MC)

PLAYER_UPDATE  (PU)

PLAYER_MOVES_START (PM)

PLAYER_OUT_OF_RANGE (PO)

PLAYER_SAYS (PS)

LOCATION_SAYS (LS)

PLAYER_EMOT (PE)

MAP_CHANGE (MX)

FOOD_CHANGE (FX)

HEAT_CHANGE (HX)

LINEAGE (LN)

NAME (NM)

APOCALYPSE (AP)

APOCALYPSE_DONE (AD)

DYING (DY)

HEALED (HE)

MONUMENT_CALL (MN)

GRAVE (GV)

GRAVE_MOVE (GM)

GRAVE_OLD (GO)

OWNER_LIST (OW)

VALLEY_SPACING (VS)

CURSED (CU)

CURSE_TOKEN_CHANGE (CX)

CURSE_SCORE_CHANGE (CS)

FLIGHT_DEST (FD)

VOG_UPDATE (VU)

PHOTO_SIGNATURE (PH)

FORCED_SHUTDOWN (SD)

FRAME (FM)

PONG


Client can expect to receive these at any time, and in any order.


Each batch of messages from a single server time step will be terminated with
a FRAME message.  This ensures that related messages can play at the same time
on the client, regardless of network latency (for example, a player picking
up an object results in a PLAYER_UPDATE and an MAP_CHANGE message, which only
make sense if played together client-side).





----
CONTAINER OBJECT FORMAT:
----

Several message contain object IDs that may optionally be containers containing
other objects.

The presence of these can be detected if the object ID field contains commas.

The format is as follows:

containerObjectID,containedID1,containedID2,containedID3,...

If the contained objects are ALSO themselves containers, their ID fields will
contain a colon-delimited list of sub-contained objects, like so:

containerObjectID,subContainerID1:subContainedID1:subContainedID2,containedID2,containedID3,...

Containment can only go two layers deep.  A wagon full of baskets full of 
carrots, for example.



CM
binary_raw_size binary_compressed_size 
#
COMPRESSED_DATA


Any message type, except MC (MAP_CHUNK), can be packaged into a CM message.

Usually, this behavior is reserved for very long messages (like the first PU
sent to a client upon connection).

After decompression, the text message is in the usual format, complete with
terminatin # character.









MC
sizeX sizeY x y
binary_raw_size binary_compressed_size 
#
COMPRESSED_BINARY_DATA


Where:
Chunk includes a sizeX x sizeY number of ids (a square of the map).
Square is positioned on map grid with upper left corner at x y
binary_size is the number of binary bytes of map data that will follow the #

BINARY_DATA is the raw binary data.  This involves zip compression.  
Check the code in map.cpp for details.

#

List of player ids with their display object ids, facing direction, action
attempt flag, action attempt target position,
held object ids (in CONTAINER OBJECT FORMAT, see above), 
whether held origin is valid (1 or 0), origin position on map of that held 
object (where it was picked up from), 
transition source object id (or -1) if held object is result of a transition,
player's current heat value, 
done_moving_seqNum (to signal destination reached), force flag (to signal
a move truncated unexpectedly), x,y grid positions of player,
floating point age in "years", floating point aging rate in sec/year (how many
seconds it takes the player to age 1 year), and
floating point move speeds (in grid square widths per second) and clothing
set, just_ate = 1 or 0 to indicate whether the player just ate what they were 
holding, the ID of the object they just ate, and the player responsible for this update.


If facing is 0, then the player's facing direction doesn't change.
If facing is 1, then they should face right, and -1 to face left.

action flag is 1 if player is attempting an action, 0 otherwise;

Heat is the player's warmth between 0 and 1, where 0 is coldest, 1 is hottest,
and 0.5 is ideal.

If done_moving_seqNum is > 0, this means the player is stationary at this position (and this is the sequence number of their last move).
Otherwise, player may still be in the middle of a move (for example, if what
they are holding decays while they are moving, a PU will be sent with
done_moving_seqNum set to 0).

force is usually 0 except in special cases of move truncation where it is 1.
A player receiving force for itself must snap back to that location
before continuing to move.

Deleted players reported in update with
X X 
for x y
and a reason string at the tail end of the line.  Reason can be

reason_disconnected
reason_killed_id   (where id is the object that killed the player)
reason_hunger
reason_nursing_hunger  (starved while nursing a hungry baby)
reason_age


Clothing sets are in the format of 
hat;tunic;front_shoe;back_shoe;bottom;backpack

Each clothing piece in the list is in the following format:

clothing_obj_id

or

clothing_obj_id,contained_id,contained_id,...

If clothing ID is 0, player is not wearing anything in that spot.


If the held object contains things, they are in the format described above
in CONTAINER OBJECT FORMAT.

If o_id (held object ID) is negative, it represents the p_id of the other
player (baby) that this player is holding.


responsible_id is used to indicate updates that were caused by another
player (so that client can defer these until responsible player finishes
local walk).  Current examples involve feeding and clothing a baby.
-1 if irrelevant.

held_yum is 1 if held item is yummy food, 0 otherwise


NOTE:
If a baby wriggles out of an adult's arms, there is no PU sent about
the adult, only about the baby.  The fact that there was a PU about
the baby indicates that they are no longer held by the adult.
This is so PU's can be interpreted as "the player is HERE right now"
and a baby can wriggle out of an adult's arms while the adult is in transit.





PM
p_id xs ys total_sec eta_sec trunc xdelt0 ydelt0 ... xdeltN ydeltN
p_id xs ys total_sec eta_sec trunc xdelt0 ydelt0 ... xdeltN ydeltN
...
p_id xs ys total_sec eta_sec trunc xdelt0 ydelt0 ... xdeltN ydeltN
#

List of player ids that just started moving, their start x y grid position,
their delta grid offsets along their path (xs + xdelt0 = first destination x), 
how long the total move should take (in case we 
come into the game in the middle of a move), and their time to arrival in 
floating point seconds

trunc is 0 for untruncated path, or 1 for truncated path.
Truncated paths are shorter than what the player originally requested.
This can happen in immediate response to the move request or later, mid-move,
if the path gets cut off (a new PM will be sent to truncate the path at that
point)

A PLAYER_UPDATE will be sent with done_moving set to 1 when these players 
reach their destination.
Until that has happened, client must assume player is still in transit.





PO
p_id
p_id
p_id
...
p_id
#

A list of player IDs that are out of range for this player.  We avoid sending
a full PU message about these players, but we need to let the client know that
they have moved out of range.







PS
p_id/isCurse text
p_id/isCurse text
p_id/isCurse text
...
p_id/isCurse text
#

isCurse is 0 if not a successful curse, or 1 if successful.

Text that each player says must not contain # or newline.

1501/1 CURSE JOHN SMITH
1448/0 HELP ME
#





LS

p_id emot_index ttl_sec
#


Example:

PE
1432 4
1501 6 30
1448 1
#


ttl_sec is optional, and specifies how long the emote should be shown, in
seconds, client-side.  If it is omitted, the client should display the emotion
for the standard amount of time.






MX
x y new_floor_id new_id p_id
x y new_floor_id new_id p_id
x y new_floor_id new_id p_id
...
x y new_floor_id new_id p_id
#


Or optionally, some lines can have 3 extra parameters, like this:

MX
x y new_floor_id new_id p_id old_x old_y speed
x y new_floor_id new_id p_id 
x y new_floor_id new_id p_id old_x old_y speed
...
x y new_floor_id new_id p_id
#

Grid position of changes, and new floor id and object id that position must 
change to.
p_id is the player that was responsible for the change (in the case of an 
object drop only), or -1 if change was not player triggered.  p_id < -1 means
that the change was triggered by player -(p_id), but that the object
wasn't dropped (transform triggered by a player action).

Note that if cell contains other stuff (for a container object), new_id
is in the CONTAINER OBJECT FORMAT described above.


Optionally, a line can contain old_x, old_y, and speed.
This indicates that the object came from the old coordinates and is moving
with a given speed.





FX
food_store food_capacity last_ate_id last_ate_fill_max move_speed responsible_id
 yum_bonus yum_multiplier#

food_store is integer amount of food left in body, capacity is the integer 
maximum amount of food.

last_ate_id is the object id of the last piece of food eaten, or 0 if nothing
was eaten recently

last_ate_fill_max is an integer number indicating how many slots were full
before what was just eaten.  Amount that what was eaten filled us up is
(food_store - last_ate_fill_max).

move_speed is floating point speed in grid square widths per second.

responsible_id is id of player that fed you if you're a baby, or -1

yum_bonus is an integer indicating the current stored bonus food.

yum_multiplier is an integer indicating how many yum bonus points are earned
when the next yummy food is eaten.




HX
heat#

Tells player about their current heat value.




LN

...
p_id mother_id grandmother_id great_grandmother_id ... eve_id eve=eve_id
#


Describes lineage of player p_id.

Each line has a variable number of fields, depending on how long the lineage
back to Eve is.

Also, if lineages get very long (like hundreds of links), the server may
cut them off beyond some point.

For long lineages, they may not go all the way back to eve_id.  To cover
these cases, the actual eve_id, even if the provided lineage doesn't reach it,
is included at the end with the eve= tag in front of it.

This message describes known lineages.





NM
p_id first_name last_name

In response to a GRAVE message from client.

underscored_name is name with spaces replaced by _
If player has no name, this will be ~ character instead.

death_age is how long the player has been dead (in in-game years)

Same semantics for eve= tag at end as for LN message.



OW

SD
#

Indicates that the server is undergoing a forced shutdown.  Gives client a
chance to hear about this and close connection before connection is
force-closed by server.




FM
#

Indicates the end of a server frame.  All messages since the last FM message
are part of the same batch and can be played back together on the client.



PONG
unique_id#

Sent by server to client in response to PING request.  Server returns
the unique ID sent by the client.




First message sent upon client new connection to server:

A map chunk message for where the player is standing, followed by 
a full player update message for ALL players on entire server.




Clients send moves in the following format:

NOTE that this format is exact, with exactly one space character between
parameters, and no leading spaces.

KA   is a keep-alive message used to keep the connection alive when the client
     is idle and not sending any other messages (NATs and other routers can
     close a connection if too long passes without outbound packets).
     The x y parameters to KA are currently ignored and can be 0, but must
     be present.

DROP is for setting held object down on empty grid square OR
	 for adding something to a container
     c is -1 except when adding something to own clothing, then c
     indicates clothing with:
     0=hat, 1=tunic, 2=frontShoe, 3=backShoe, 4=bottom, 5=backpack

USE  is for bare-hand or held-object action on target object in non-empty 
     grid square, including picking something up (if there's no bare-handed 
     action), and picking up a container.

SELF is special case of USE action taken on self (to eat what we're holding
     or add/remove clothing).
     This differentiates between use actions on the object at our feet
     (same grid cell as us) and actions on ourself.
     If holding food i is ignored.
	 If not holding food, then SELF removes clothing, and i specifies
	 clothing slot:
     0=hat, 1=tunic, 2=frontShoe, 3=backShoe, 4=bottom, 5=backpack
	 
BABY is special case of USE action taken on a baby to pick them up.
     They are dropped with the normal DROP action.
     NOTE the alternate call for BABY with extra id parameter.
     this specifies a specific person to pick up, if more than one is
	 close to the target tile.

UBABY is a special case of SELF applied to a baby (to feed baby food
	  or add/remove clothing from baby).  Also works on elderly.
      Note that server currently allows UBABY to feed anyone food, but
      only putting clothing on babies and elderly.
      ALSO:  UBABY is used for healing wounded players.
      Essentially, any action where held item is used on another player.
      Should be called UOTHER, but UBABY is used for historical reasons.
      NOTE the alternate call for UBABY with extra id parameter.
      this specifies a specific person to do the action on, if more than one is
	  close to the target tile.

REMV is special case of removing an object from a container.
     i specifies the index of the container item to remove, or -1 to
	 remove top of stack.

SREMV is special case of removing an object contained in a piece of worn 
      clothing.
      c specifies the clothing slot to remove from:  0=hat, 1=tunic, 
         2=frontShoe, 3=backShoe, 4=bottom, 5=backpack
      i specifies the index of the container item to remove, or -1 to
	  remove top of stack.

KILL is for using a deadly object on the target square.  Square can
     be non-adjacent depending on deadly distance of held object.
     If another player is located there (even if moving and crossing)
	 they will be killed.
     NOTE the alternate call for KILL with extra id parameter.
     this specifies a specific person to kill, if more than one is
	 close to the target tile.

JUMP is used by a baby to jump out of its mother's arms.  The x and y 
     coordinates are ignored.
     MOVE can NO LONGER be used to jump out of arms (it was the old way).
     It was less safe, because bad message interleavings server-side make
     MOVE ambiguous in the case of jump-out (for example, if the baby
     has already been dropped by the time the MOVE arrives, the server will
     interpret it as a legitimate move attempt).

EMOT is used to specify an emotion to display.  The x and y coordinates are
     ignored.  e is the emotion index.

DIE  is used to trigger sudden infant death for a held baby.  The server
     enforces various conditions that limit when this command can be effective.
     (For example, age < 1 and held by mother).  The x and y coordinates are
     ignored.

FORCE  is used to acknowledge a forced-pos PU sent previously by the server.
       The x and y coordinates must match the forced position in the PU.
       Forced-pos PU's act like sync points.  After sending one to the client,
       the server will ignore all position-sensitive moves and actions until
       a FORCE arrives, demonstrating that the client is in sync with the forced
       position, and that subsequent moves carry forward from that forced
       position (otherwise, additional moves/actions sent by the client after
       its move that was cut off by the forced-pos PU, but before the client
       actually receive that PU, can be misinterpreted by the server).

PING is used to request a PONG response fromt the server.  The x and y 
     coordinates are ignored.  The unique_id parameter will be returned
     in the PONG response.

PHOTO is used to request a photo approval and signature for position
      x y and sequence number seq


This one is more complicated:

MOVE xs ys @seq_num xdelt0 ydelt0 xdelt1 ydelt1 ... xdeltN ydeltN#


seq_num is the sequence number of moves in this player's lifetime, starting
        with 2 for their first move.

xs,ys is the absolute world position the player thinks they're currently at

the pairs of deltas represent steps along an obstacle-free path that the player
wants to take to their destination xdeltN,ydeltN

These deltas are relative to xs,ys and will be rejected if they are larger
than +/- 16 (the maximum allowed path search radius.


Note that USE, DROP, and REMV actions are ignored while a MOVE is in progress 
(until the server sends a PU to indicate that the move is finished and the
 destination has been reached).  SAY can happen during a move, however.




SAY 0 0 text#


SAY text cannot contain the # character and will be truncated at the
    player's age-speech limit (age in years + 1 character).

    The x y parameters to SAY are currently ignored and can be 0, but must
    be present.




Finally, special commands client can send, but only if the server
is configured to allow it (if disabled on server, they have no effect)

MAP x y#

Requests a map chunk centered on (x,y)




TRIGGER trigger_number#

Sends trigger trigger_number to server.

Example:

TRIGGER 5#




BUG v arbitrary_text#

Reports that a bug with number v occurred, and provides text about that bug.

Example:

BUG 4 MOVE -144 960 -1 -1 -2 -1#
